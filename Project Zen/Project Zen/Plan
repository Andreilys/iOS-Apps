so basically what I want to do is when someone clicks heart or the zen buttoni want to save to the user defaults that this person now has favorited this

-then when the view loads, I want to check if the person has favorited this or not. If they have, disable the button, if they havent enable the button


PROBLEMS:
-whenever you remove an item from favorites, it stil lsays its a favorite
need to make it so that when you reload the viewcontroller screen it repopulates again
