Technical Challenges:

1) So I need to use core data to save the user info, and be able to look it up
2) I need to use local notifications to push information to the users device
3) Playing sound
4) loading quotes from parse server

Ok so basically 31 days of Zen, each day gives a new zen challenge, you check off if oyu compleed or not.

sends local push notifications in the morning and the evening.

pulls the challenges from the Parse backend, that way each month I can load new zen challenges (if I need to)
