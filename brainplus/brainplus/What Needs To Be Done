Important/Must need:
Background for the 4 different categories
logo+name for the app
ability to upvote/downvote different supplements
submission (and ability to pull from a database the information on the submission)
ability to pull and show the information
save a supplement to favorites
create journal entries
store and pull journal entries

Nice to have:

Step 0: DONE
Create wireframes with POP

Step 1: DONE
Create the submission page, and have it deposit all the information to Parse

Step 2: DONE
create the unique view cell that will populate table view controller

Step 3: DONE
Table view should be able to pull info from Parse and display

Step 4: DONE
-Rearrange the cells based on the vote score

Step 5: DONE
Store in Parse the vote score, and be able to pull it to display

Step 6: DONE
Create the favorites page

Step 7:
Create the journals page

Step 8:
UI/UX Work


Bugs:
Doesn't load after submission is submitted
make tableview rearrangable
have favorites unselect when view loads
need to create a star that lights up/lights off depending on whether something is a favorite or not
basically if you have the same name for a supplement, but a different type, then you will not be able to load it in the favorites bar (it will only load one for some reason)
If you save something to favorites, it will be favorites for everyone, not just one person
