Important/Must need:
Background for the 4 different categories
logo+name for the app
ability to upvote/downvote different supplements
submission (and ability to pull from a database the information on the submission)
ability to pull and show the information
save a supplement to favorites
create journal entries
store and pull journal entries

Nice to have:

Step 0: DONE
Create wireframes with POP

Step 1: DONE
Create the submission page, and have it deposit all the information to Parse

Step 2: DONE
create the unique view cell that will populate table view controller

Step 3: DONE
Table view should be able to pull info from Parse and display

Step 4: UNFINISHED
-Rearrange the cells based on the vote score

Step 5: DONE
Store in Parse the vote score, and be able to pull it to display

Step 6:
Create the favorites page

Step 7:
Create the journals page

Step 8:
UI/UX Work


Bugs:
Doesn't load after submission is submitted
make tableview rearrangable
have favorites unselect when view loads
need to create a start that lights up/lights off depending on whether something is true or not
basically if you have the same name for a supplement, but a different type, then you will not be able to load it in the favorites bar (it will only load one for some reason)
